# DSA-Project
Searching for patterns in a given text file using trie and suffix tree data structures and implementing KMP and finite automata algorithms

To run this code 
There are choices in the main function using switch cases to ask the user if he/she wants to run the pattern searching algorithm using trie, suffix tree, KMP or finite automata algorithm.
Choice 1: Suffix Tree Data Structure
Choice 2: Trie Data Structure
Choice 3: KMP algorithm
Choice 4: Finite Automata algorithm

If you choose choice 2, then a smaller text file will be opened since the time complexity of trie is O(m^2)
For other choices, the larger text file opens

The next input will be the string of the pattern to be searched.
The output will be the number of occurrences of the pattern in the text file, the line number, and the position in the line of the text file.
